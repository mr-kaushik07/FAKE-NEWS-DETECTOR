# FAKE-NEWS-DETECTOR
I have developed a fake news detector using machine learning libraries in Python. The project involves training a machine learning model using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which consists of labeled news articles as either fake or genuine. By utilizing this dataset, the model has learned to distinguish between authentic and fabricated news pieces.
These days fake news is creating different issues from sarcastic articles to a fabricated news and plan government propaganda in some outlets. We witnessed some riots happening because of fake news in the media. There are various platforms where we can see these fake news floating over a range of community over the internet such as Whatsapp, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc.So there is huge need to overcome this issue whether the news is either real or fake.For making the solution to this problem we used machine learning and data analytics.

# HOW TO USE (IN FUTURE)
STEP 1:
User have to input the author of the news or article
STEP 2:
User will input the publication or the site on which it is published
STEP 3:
User will finally input the news article content 
STEP 4:
User will click on verify button and have to wait for while until when the machine will access the news
STEP 5:
User will get the results as "The news is REAL" or "The news is FAKE"

# OBJECTIVE
The main objective is to detect the fake news, which is a classic text classification problem with a straight forward proposition. It is needed to build a model that can differentiate between “Real” news and “Fake” news using machine leaning and data analysis.

# UNIQUENESS 
There is no such model in the market which is predicting whether the news is real or fake.So, this model will be a boom in the media and the society. Instagram usually deletes the pictures or news but it is when the news or picture reaches to many public but our project will predict whether the news is real or fake in just some seconds.It is easy to use and cost friendly and it is also cross platform project.

# DATASET USED 
The data we used in making the machine learning model is too large to upload so we are uploading the link of the dataset here.
