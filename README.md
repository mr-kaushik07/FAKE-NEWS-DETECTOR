# FAKE-NEWS-DETECTOR
I have developed a fake news detector using machine learning libraries in Python. The project involves training a machine learning model using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which consists of labeled news articles as either fake or genuine. By utilizing this dataset, the model has learned to distinguish between authentic and fabricated news pieces.
